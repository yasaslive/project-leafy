### Image capture method 

I'm using a DSLR (Nikon D3400 With 55mm Lens) to capture the images for the leaves. The camera is placed at adequate 
height and focus the object properly with the lens. For lightning i use two led lights and two diffusers. To get good 
level of details I used a clear 200x200x4mm clear class plate.
